# Placement-end-to-end-project
This project appears to be a machine learning classification task where a dataset containing CGPA and IQ scores is used to predict a binary outcome (likely placement or not). The data is split into training and testing sets, missing values are handled using mean/median imputation, and a classifier (possibly Logistic Regression or SVM) is trained. The decision boundary visualization shows how the model separates the two classes, with blue and orange regions representing different predictions. The model's performance can be evaluated further using accuracy metrics or by experimenting with more complex algorithms.
